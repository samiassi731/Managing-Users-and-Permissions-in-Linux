# Linux User and Permission Management Project

## Introduction
This project demonstrates hands-on experience in **Linux user and permission management** using a virtual machine. The goal was to build practical skills in system administration and security by managing user accounts, passwords, groups, and access control.

## Objectives
In this project, I gained experience in:
- Creating and confirming new user accounts, with and without home directories.
- Setting and managing user passwords and properties (including default shells).
- Assigning users to groups to control privileges.
- Locking and unlocking user accounts for security enforcement.
- Safely deleting users and their associated data.

These exercises strengthened my understanding of Linux authentication, access control, and best practices for enforcing security policies and least-privilege principles.

## Lab Environment & Tools
- **OS:** Ubuntu/Debian Linux virtual machine
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Terminal / Linux shell  
  - `useradd`, `usermod`, `passwd`, `userdel`  
  - `groups` for checking group membership  
  - `grep` for searching configuration files and logs  
  - `sudo` for performing administrative tasks securely  

## Screenshots
Screenshots of the commands and outputs are available in the document to demonstrate the steps and results.

## Notes
- All exercises were performed in a controlled virtual environment.
- All commands are documented and accompanied by explanations to support learning and provide a reference.

## Conclusion
This project provides a solid foundation in Linux user and permission management, which is an essential skill for system administration and cybersecurity roles. It demonstrates my ability to perform administrative tasks securely and effectively in a Linux environment.
